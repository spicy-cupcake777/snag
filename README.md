# snag-dom

A simple Python project to make accessing HTML elements easier; really more of an experiment than a full-fledged project.

It is recommended that you create a virtual environment before installing.
`pip install virtualenv`
`virtualenv ev`
`source ev/bin/activate`

Then install snag-dom.
`pip install snag-dom`

To use, simply call `S` with the CSS selector and the URL you intend to select elements from.
`from snag-dom import S
header = S('h1', 'http://www.example.com')[0]
print(header)`
